# Vague Expo CLI Build Error: Troubleshooting Native Module and Version Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue with the Expo CLI: encountering vague build errors that provide minimal diagnostic information.  This often occurs during the build process for both Android and iOS platforms.  The problem can be caused by several factors, primarily:

* **Version Mismatches:** Incompatibilities between your Expo CLI version, `expo` and `eas-cli` packages in `package.json`, and potentially native module dependencies.
* **Native Module Configuration:** Problems in setting up and building native modules within the Android (`android/`) and/or iOS (`ios/`) directories.
* **Node.js Environment:**  Issues in the underlying Node.js environment, including conflicting package versions.

The goal is to illustrate the troubleshooting steps needed to resolve this kind of vague error, helping developers pinpoint the source of the problem and apply suitable solutions.

## Reproduction Steps

(Note: Reproduction steps will vary significantly depending on the specific cause. The provided example focuses on a native module configuration issue.)
