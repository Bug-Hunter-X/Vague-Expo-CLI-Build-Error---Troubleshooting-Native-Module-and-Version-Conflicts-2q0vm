This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the project's configuration, particularly the `expo` and `eas-cli` versions in your `package.json`.  It can also stem from issues with your Android or iOS build configurations, or problems with the underlying Node.js environment.  The error message itself is often not very descriptive, making it hard to pinpoint the root cause. One specific scenario is when you're trying to build an app that depends on a native module but haven't properly configured the native projects (Android's `android/` or iOS's `ios/` directories).
